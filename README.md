# Travel-Dataset-Analysis-Make-My-Trip-
A data cleaning and exploratory analysis project using a travel dataset inspired by MakeMyTrip. This project dives into the nuances of real-world data preprocessing and builds the foundation for further modeling and business insights.


 ## Project Overview
  - Domain: Travel & Booking Data
  - Focus: Data cleaning, parsing, regex-based feature extraction
  - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Regex, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Notebook size: 41 code cells

## Key Highlights
  - Extracted and formatted travel-related fields such as dates, durations, and cities from complex raw text using Python string operations.
  - Performed deep data cleaning, including:
  - Removing unwanted symbols
  - Parsing duration fields like 2h 50m, 1h, 5m
  - Handling missing values and null columns
  - Detected and resolved inconsistencies in flight stop data (e.g., 1 stop, non-stop)
  - Created structured columns from unstructured raw strings like airline names, departure/arrival times, etc.

## Scope
  - Integrate with flight price prediction models
  - Add geospatial data for route analysis
  - Extend analysis to hotel bookings and bundles

## Learning Outcomes
  - Improved regex, string manipulation, and feature engineering
  - Gained hands-on experience in handling inconsistent real-world data formats
